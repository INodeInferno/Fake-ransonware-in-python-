# Fake-ransonware-in-python-
Just a silly joke script that simulates a legit ransomware situation in python. Does not harm device or data. 
To end the fake attack you simoly press escape and the message will "decrypt" data in 5 second and end the simulation. 
if escape is not pressed amd timer runs out then the automation triggers a fake reboot with absolutly nothing happening to device and data.
